# DS-P04-Flight-Planner

Created a Flight Planner in C++ to determine best path of travel for users based upon cheapest price, shortest travel time,
and fewest layovers. Implemented custom Doubly LinkedList, Stack, and Adjacency List class while using iterative backtracking. 
Created unit tests with Catch interface to test all custom class implementations.

Final version of the program runs from the command line with the following arguments:

  > ./flightPlan FlightInputData.txt CalculateRequestedPath.txt OutputFile.txt

Alternatively, calling the program with no arguments runs the CATCH tests:

  > ./flightPlan
